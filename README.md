## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### EC2 Examples

Create a new instance

ben-awscli list
```
Stop an instance (by ID)

```bash
ben-awscli stop {Instance ID}
```
Start an instance (by ID)

```bash
ben-awscli start {Instance ID}
```

### S3 Examples

Create a new bucket (private by default):

```bash
ben-awscli s3create mybucket123
```

Create a new bucket as public-read (with confirmation):

```bash
ben-awscli s3create mybucket123 --public
```

Upload a file to a bucket:

```bash
ben-awscli s3upload --bucket mybucket123 --file ./hello.txt
```

List all buckets created by this CLI:

```bash
ben-awscli s3list
```

## üì∏ Demo Evidence

```bash
$ ben-awscli ec2create TestInstance
Created instance: i-0abcde12345f67890, named: TestInstance

$ ben-awscli ec2list
Instance id: i-0abcde12345f67890
Instance name: TestInstance
State: running
Type: t3.micro
IP: 3.23.45.67

$ ben-awscli s3create mybucket123
Bucket mybucket123 created (private).

$ ben-awscli s3upload --bucket mybucket123 --file ./hello.txt
Uploaded ./hello.txt to s3://mybucket123/hello.txt

$ ben-awscli s3list
- mybucket123

```
